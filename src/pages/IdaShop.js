            Ida Andersson LLC is a hand-made, Swedish Cozy Wear apparel brand that specializes in bespoke and custom-made clothing for women. 
            The brand was established in the wake of the Covid-19 Pandemic by Ida and Harry. Together, we sold over 400 uniquely hand-made items in the first 12-months of operation, as well as MOQ's to boutiques in the Portland Area.

            My role in Ida Andersson Shop is heavily involved with web development, digital content creation, marketing, and networking. 
            <br/>
            I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty so I also do all the fabric cutting, trimming and preparation of garments to help with production efficiency.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This has been an incredibly rewarding experience. For both Ida and I, Ida Andersson LLC really was a 'proving ground' for both of us to combine our skils together to make something that we feel is successful!
