            Ida has oever 17 years of sewing experience oversees apparel design and construction, while my role is heavily involved with web development, eCommerce, content creation, marketing, and networking. 
            <br/>
            I also do all the fabric cutting by hand. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, and together - Ida and I have been built an efficient Order Management System that is profitable and sustainable for our business. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This has been the most fun and incredibly rewarding experience in so many aspects. It was the catalyst for why I wanted to pursue studying web development.
            <br/>
            <br />
            And, for Ida and I, Ida Andersson LLC was a 'proving ground,' and freedom to see what we could build together when we combine our skils and creativity!
