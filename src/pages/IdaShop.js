            Ida Andersson LLC is a hand-made, Swedish-American apparel brand that specializes in bespoke, custom-made "Cozy Wear" for women. 
            The brand was created as an established LLC business in April 2020 by Ida and Harrison. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Together, we produced and sold over 400 uniquely hand-made items in our first 12-months. We also sell MOQ's to boutiques in the Portland Area.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ida has over 17 years of sewing experience and oversees apparel design and construction, while my role covers: web development, SEO/SEM/Email Marketing, eCommerce, content creation, Customer Service, Shipping and Order Management, and networking. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My mission was to create a sort 'aura' around what Ida Andersson could be. Kind of like Coco Chanel or Kate Spade. Even though they're real people, their brands use their names to almost mystify and create this aura around them.
            <br/>
            I also cut all our fabric by hand and I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This has been the most fun and incredibly rewarding experience in so many aspects. It was also the catalyst for why I wanted to pursue studying web development!
            <br/>
            <br />
            For Ida and I, Ida Andersson LLC was a 'proving ground,' and freedom to go 'all-in' and see what we could build together when we combine all our skils and creativity!
