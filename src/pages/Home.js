          <h5 className="home-blurb">I want to use my skills as a brand and digital product storyteller to collaborate on a team in order create compelling, inspiring, and demand-driving products on a much larger scale. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
Over the past year, I’ve dialed my skills as a software developer and journalist to create impactful products that leave a positive impact and generate revenue. 
<br/>
Due to circumstances posed by the pandemic, I acquired a business license and teamed up with my business partner to create a hand-made apparel brand called “Ida Andersson Shop” that specializes in Swedish-crafted Cozy Wear for women. 
<br/>
My role focuses on web development and brand marketing through creating organic content that inspires our customers and drive sales. 
<br/>
<br/>
We made and sold 400 items in our first 12 months out of a small studio apartment - All by hand and even sold at boutiques in Portland.
<br/>
<br/>
I want to take my skills and what I’ve learned as a journalist, as an entrepreneur, and as a growing software developer to create products that engage, inspire, and sell.
