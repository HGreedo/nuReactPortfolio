            <h1>Hello! My name is Harry Reed</h1>


            <h6 className="tldr"> TL:DR I own a Small Women's Apparel Brand, recently graduated from a Full-Stack Web Bootcamp and currently work as an associate at Snow Peak's Warehouse. I like to create product experiences that inspire people towards positive action. </h6>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, but grew up overseas for 10 and a half years in Hong Kong and Amsterdam before getting my undergrad in Journalism and Fashion Marketing at the University of Arizona.
                <br/>
                <br/>                
                <br/>
                Starting Ida Andersson Shop, and learning how to incorporate Etsy, Wix, Wordpress, Google Tag, Analytics, Pinterest, and Instagram, etc. evolved into this passion and insatiable desire to learn more about digital content creation and management.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Which, ultimately led me to embarking on this coding journey and 6-month Full Stack Flex Bootcamp through U of Oregon.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Like Ida Andersson, the Bootcamp was a fantastic platform to develop my computational skills, theory, and application. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I am a risk taker, (big believer in "You make zero percent of the shots you don't take), and I wanted to create a Final Project that would help me develop my understanding and application of all the course material. 
                <br />
                <br/>
                So, unlike my peers who were paired in groups of 4-5, I opted to do my Final Project completely own my own. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I conducted my own market research, ran a 'mini focus group' with students at the U of Oregon Sports Product Masters Program, and built the entire backend / frontend configuration, as well as styling and routing on my own.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It may still be in 'development', but the entire process and the challenges of learning and applying "on-the-spot, " was an experience that gave me confidence to know that I can do this professionally.
