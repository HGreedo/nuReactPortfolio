            <h1>Hello! My name is Harry Reed</h1>


            <h6 className="tldr"> TL:DR I own a Small Women's Apparel Brand, recently graduated from a Full-Stack Web Bootcamp and currently work as an associate at Snow Peak's Warehouse. I like to create digital product experiences that inspire people towards positive action. </h6>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I'm originally from Portland, Oregon, but grew up overseas for 10 and a half years in Hong Kong and Amsterdam before getting my undergrad in Journalism and Fashion Marketing at the University of Arizona.
                <br/>
                <br/>                
                <br/>
                Starting Ida Andersson Shop, learning how to incorporate Google SEO/SEM, Etsy, Wix, Wordpress, Google Analytics / Tag Manager, Pinterest, and Instagram, evolved into this passion and insatiable desire to learn and create effective digital content and successfully market it!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Ultimately, my love for building 'organic' digital content led me to embark on this software coding journey and the Full Stack Web Deveopment Bootcamp through U of Oregon.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The Bootcamp was a fantastic platform to develop my computational skills, theory, and application, while also combining my skills as a producer and marketer to create 1 of 1 concepts in the form of Final Projects! 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I am a huge risk taker, big believer in "You make zero percent of the shots you don't take," and my favorite quote that I've been running with since Covid is, "Light Yourself on Fire and Find People Who Fuel Your Flames." For me, that means collaborate, listen to others, and foster community. 
                <br />
                <br/>
                One unique experience, was that, unlike my peers who were paired in groups of 4-5, I opted to do my Final Project completely own my own. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I conducted my own market research, ran a 'mini focus group' with students at the U of Oregon Sports Product Masters Program, and built the entire backend / frontend configuration, as well as styling and routing on my own.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The entire process and the challenges of learning and applying "on-the-spot, " was an experience that gave me confidence and the wherewithal to know that I can do this as a career!
